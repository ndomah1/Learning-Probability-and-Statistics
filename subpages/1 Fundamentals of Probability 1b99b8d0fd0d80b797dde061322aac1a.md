# 1. Fundamentals of Probability

# Basic Probability Concepts

## Key Definitions

- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space
- **Probability of an event (P(E)):** The ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

**Formula:**

## Example 1: Coin Toss

**Problem:** You flip a fair coin. What is the probability of getting heads?

**Solution:**

- Sample Space: $S = \text{ \{Heads, Tails\} }$
- Favorable Outcome: Getting Heads
- Total Outcomes: 2 (Heads or Tails)

$$
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
$$

## Example 2: Rolling a Die

**Problem:** What is the probability of rolling a 4 on a fair six-sided die?

**Solution:** 

- Sample Space: $S = \text{ \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}}$
- Favorable Outcome: Rolling a 4
- Total Outcomes: 6

$$
P(4) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667
$$

## Practice Problems

1. A bag contains 3 red balls, 2 blue balls, and 5 green balls. If one ball is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is:
    1. Red?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Red}) = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3
        $$
        
    2. Blue?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Blue}) = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2
        $$
        
    3. Green?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Green}) = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
        $$
        
    4. Not Red?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Not Red}) = 1 - P(\text{Red}) = 1 - \frac{3}{10} = \frac{7}{10} = 0.7
        $$
        
2. A deck of 52 cards is shuffled. What is the probability of drawing:
    1. A heart?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
        $$
        
    2. A king?
        
        $$
        P(\text{King}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} \approx 0.0769
        $$
        
    3. A red card?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Red Card}) = \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
        $$
        
    4. The ace of spades?
        
        $$
        P(\text{Ace of Spades}) = \frac{1}{52} \approx 0.0192
        $$
